                I have had some prior experience designing pages with HTML and CSS. However, I did it without deep knowledge of the different components it takes to make these webpages. 
                While I could create these web pages, it felt wrong to do so without understanding the internal components, particularly the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. 
                I had no idea whatsoever about that, but I have gained a clear understanding while completing this project. CSS styling was quite hard, and debugging became an important process 
                because my elements didn't align as expected. One of the key aspects of my learning was understanding the principles of responsive design. I used various online resources to learn about media queries and how to implement them effectively. (Kumra, 2019)
            </p>

            <p> To provide a consistent and familiar experience, I used the same headers and footers across all pages. I added the social media links on the footer. The color scheme I chose was based on creating a calm and professional look, inspired by some design blogs.
                In terms of font, I opted for Arial font to enhance readability and maintain a professional appearance. In my index.html page, I incorporated a picture to grab the user's attention and included sections showcasing my skills and interests.
                For projects.html, I included three placeholder projects. (Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), n.d.) I used a common and simple box shadow effect. (CSS Scan, n.d.) Finally, on the contact.html page, I wanted to share more about myself, so I placed an image with my personal information side-by-side with a contact form.
                The videoDemo and sitereport page was simple. I added an iframe from MediaSpace and paragraphs with validation screenshots on the report page. Additionally, I used some references to get ideas regaring many concepts which I have put in the references section.
            </p>

            <p>Reflecting on this module, I have gained a lot of understanding regarding CSS design. Initially, I focused on making the website work functional. However, I also realized the importance of user-friendliness. 
                So, I had to manage the different color components and sections to create a cohesive design. I aimed for complementary colors whenever possible. Also, I had trouble handling media queries because we dealt with this only a little bit in this module. 
                Ultimately, the experience was knowledgeable and fun.
